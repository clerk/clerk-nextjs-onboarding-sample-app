## Introduction

Clerk is a developer-first authentication and user management solution. It provides pre-built React components and hooks for sign-in, sign-up, user profile, and organization management. Clerk is designed to be easy to use and customize, and can be dropped into any React or Next.js application.

The user onboarding flow plays a crucial role in your application development journey, and Clerk significantly simplifies this process with built-in tooling like [customizable session data](https://clerk.com/docs/users/metadata#public-metadata), [middleware](https://clerk.com/docs/references/nextjs/auth-middleware#auth-middleware) in the [Next.js SDK](https://clerk.com/docs/references/nextjs/overview).

This repo is a working implementation of a full stack Next.js app showcasing how to leverage Clerk for your user onboarding flow and includes the following:

- Fully functional auth flow leveraging the Account Portal
- Hooks for accessing user data and authentication state
- Customized clerkMiddleware to leverage state for redirect
